/**
 * You will build a number guessing game where the player has a limited amount of time to guess a randomly generated number.

How the game works:

The game picks a random number between 1 and 10.
The player has 10 seconds to guess the number.
The player can input guesses, and after each guess, theyâ€™re told if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
If they guess correctly or run out of time, the game ends.
